# Future Enhancements for QuantaLista

This document outlines potential future enhancements for the QuantaLista ecosystem, organized by the service they would most likely belong to.

## `QuantaLista-Advisor`: Intelligence and Optimization

- **Advanced Anomaly Detection via Machine Learning:**
  - Train ML models on historical workflow data from `QuantaLista-Core` to proactively identify potential bottlenecks or predict task failures.
  - Detect abnormal agent behavior (e.g., significant deviation in task completion time, unusual resource consumption).
- **Predictive Task & Resource Scheduling:**
  - Use ML to forecast agent workload and provide scheduling recommendations back to the `Core` service.
  - For cloud-based deployments, provide analytics to help automatically scale agent resources.

## `QuantaLista-Core`: Ecosystem and Integration

- **Expanded Integration with External Knowledge Bases:**
  - Provide native connectors for vector databases (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate) and enterprise search tools.
  - Allow agents to dynamically and securely query these knowledge bases to gather information needed for task completion.
- **Plugin Architecture:**
  - Develop a robust plugin system allowing third parties to contribute new agent types, communication protocols, or integrations with external tools (e.g., Jira, GitHub).

## `QuantaLista-UI`: User Experience and Observability

- **Real-time Multi-Agent Workflow Visualization:**
  - Create an interactive, real-time graph or Gantt chart that visualizes task dependencies, agent assignments, and progress by fetching data from the `Gateway`.
  - Allow users to click on nodes (tasks, agents) to drill down into detailed logs and metrics.
- **User-Customizable Alerting and Reporting:**
  - Implement a flexible rule engine for users to define custom alert conditions (e.g., "Alert me if a high-priority task is in the queue for more than 10 minutes").
  - Generate configurable periodic reports on workflow efficiency, cost analysis, and overall system performance.
