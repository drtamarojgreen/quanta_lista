# Development Plan for QuantaLista

This document outlines the development plan for the QuantaLista ecosystem, which is composed of multiple independent services.

## Phase 1: Core Functionality (Completed)

**Objective:** Build the fundamental components for task and agent management.
**Status:** Implemented and released as the **`QuantaLista-Core`** service.

- **Core Data Models & Scope:**
  - Finalized data structures for `Task`, `Agent`, `Workflow`, and `Project`.
  - Specified the core API for task submission, agent registration, and status updates.
- **Core Scheduling Engine:**
  - Developed a robust priority queue and dependency tracking for task management.
  - Created a basic agent state manager (`IDLE`, `BUSY`, `ERROR`).

## Phase 2: Intelligence and Observability

**Objective:** Add monitoring and intelligent oversight via a dedicated service.
**Service:** **`QuantaLista-Advisor`**

- **Monitoring and Alerting:**
  - The Advisor service will consume event streams from `QuantaLista-Core`.
  - It will implement comprehensive logging and provide a basic dashboard for system state visualization.
- **Advisory and Alignment Modules:**
  - The service will provide recommendations (e.g., re-prioritizing tasks).
  - It will perform checks to ensure agent actions align with workflow goals.

## Phase 3: User Interface and API Gateway

**Objective:** Provide user-facing controls and a unified API.
**Services:** **`QuantaLista-UI`** and **`QuantaLista-Gateway`**

- **API Gateway (`QuantaLista-Gateway`):**
  - Develop a lightweight gateway to route traffic to the `Core` and `Advisor` services.
  - Implement centralized concerns like authentication and rate limiting.
- **User Interface (`QuantaLista-UI`):**
  - Build a web-based UI that communicates with the API gateway.
  - Provide workflow visualization, manual task management, and agent status views.
