# Development Plan for QuantaLista

This plan outlines the phased development of QuantaLista, from a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to a feature-rich platform.

## Phase 1: Core Functionality (MVP)

**Objective:** Build the fundamental components for task and agent management.

- **Define Core Data Models & Scope:**
  - Research common multi-agent patterns (e.g., collaborative writing, research, software development).
  - Finalize data structures for `Task`, `Agent`, `Workflow`, and `Project`.
  - Specify the core API for task submission, agent registration, and status updates.
- **Implement Core Scheduling Engine:**
  - Develop a robust priority queue for task management.
  - Implement dependency tracking to manage task execution order (e.g., Task B cannot start until Task A is complete).
  - Create a basic agent state manager (e.g., `IDLE`, `BUSY`, `ERROR`).

## Phase 2: Intelligence and Observability

**Objective:** Add monitoring and basic intelligent oversight.

- **Design Monitoring and Alerting Mechanisms:**
  - Implement comprehensive logging for all major events (task status changes, agent activity, errors).
  - Develop a basic dashboard to visualize system state, active agents, and the task queue.
  - Configure simple alerts for critical failures (e.g., unresponsive agents, persistent task failures).
- **Implement Advisory and Alignment Modules:**
  - Create a simple "Advisor" module that provides recommendations (e.g., suggest re-prioritizing a task that is blocking others).
  - Implement basic checks to ensure agent actions align with overall workflow goals.

## Phase 3: Advanced Coordination and User Control

**Objective:** Enhance agent collaboration and provide user-facing controls.

- **Integrate Multi-Agent Coordination:**
  - Implement a message bus (e.g., RabbitMQ, Redis Pub/Sub) for inter-agent communication.
  - Develop initial conflict resolution strategies (e.g., locking mechanisms for shared resources).
- **Develop User Interface (UI):**
  - Build a web-based UI for workflow visualization, manual task management, and viewing agent status.
  - Implement user controls for manually assigning tasks and overriding priorities.
